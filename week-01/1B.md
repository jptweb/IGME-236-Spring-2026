# Week 1 Day 2: Sketch Critique

> **What is this?** You're the users of this class, and I want to deliver a good experience. Think of it like a restaurant - you expect your order to be correct, the food to be filling, and the meal to be worth your time. But it might not be fine dining presentation with fancy garnishes.
>
> These markdown "presentations" let me prioritize **substance over polish** - getting the content right, making adjustments on the fly, and responding to what actually happens in class. They don't replace the myCourses checklists (that's your to-do list). This is what we work through together in class.
>
> Also: this is a UX course. Consider this an early example of trade-offs in design.

## Course Structure: What You Do Each Week

**What you do each week:**

| Component | When Due | What It Is |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Readings + Study Quiz** | Tuesday before class | Prep for lecture, low-stakes quiz |
| **Sketches** | Thursday before class | Visual thinking, bring to critique |
| **Writeup** | Sunday 11:59 PM | 300-500 words reflecting on sketch + critique |
| **Discussion** | Varies | In-class or async participation |

- Study quizzes = check you did the reading, not gotcha tests
- Writeups = this is Writing Intensive, writing quality matters
- Sketches = thinking tool, not art class

## Reading Highlights

**PBS "How to Critique"**

The video says critique is MOST instructive for the person **giving** it - you learn by formulating your opinions into words.

**The 5 Guidelines:**
1. **Be Attentive** - look multiple times, opinion may change
2. **Don't Be Lazy** - say WHY, not just "interesting" or "I like it"
3. **Be Generous** - making takes courage, look for "aspects of wonder"
4. **Find Your Entry Point** - what does it remind you of? what decisions were made?
5. **Don't Be a Jerk** - pretend you're in the same room

> "Critique can be an incredible act of empathy."

**Berkun - Giving Feedback:**
- **Know the goals first** - what problem does this solve? (You can't critique if you don't know what it's trying to do)
- **Separate preference from quality** - your taste ≠ objective truth
- **PNP sandwich** - positive, then negative, then positive (formulaic but it works)

**Berkun - Receiving Feedback:**
- Listen without defending
- Ask clarifying questions
- "How would you fix it?"

## Critique Setup

**Form groups of 4-5**

**Your job:**
- Show your two sketches (good design vs bad design object)
- Explain your choices
- Get feedback from the group
- Give feedback to others

**Take notes for your writeup:**

- Could they understand your sketch?
- Could they see the differences between good/bad?
- What questions did they ask?
- What suggestions did they make?
- Could they read your labels?
- Did you feel personally criticized? (If so, why?)
- What did you notice about others' sketches?
