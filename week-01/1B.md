# Week 1 Day 2: Sketch Critique

> **What is this?** You're the users of this class, and I want to deliver a good experience. Think of it like a restaurant - you expect your order to be correct, the food to be filling, and the meal to be worth your time. But it might not be fine dining presentation with fancy garnishes.
>
> These markdown "presentations" let me prioritize **substance over polish** - getting the content right, making adjustments on the fly, and responding to what actually happens in class. They don't replace the myCourses checklists (that's your to-do list). This is what we work through together in class.
>
> Also: this is a UX course. Consider this an early example of trade-offs in design.

Side topic: 
- maybe you will start thinking about UX everywhere in your day to day life. I have already been much more aware of my course delivery even though it has nothing to do with building games!
- You will start noticing annoying things in everyday life!: https://imgur.com/a/VRTKpB7
- I can even connect this back to my Finger Lakes Wine Country ex from day 1 (https://www.fingerlakeswinecountry.com/)

## Course Structure: What You Do Each Week

I realize I missed covering this fully last class so adding it here!

*(This is from the [syllabus](../documents/syllabus.md#navigating-mycourses) — check out the full breakdown of how myCourses is organized and the weekly rhythm.)*

**What you do each week:**

| Component | When Due | What It Is |
|-----------|----------|------------|
| **Readings + Study Quiz** | Tuesday before class | Prep for lecture, low-stakes quiz |
| **Sketches** | Thursday before class | Visual thinking, bring to critique |
| **Writeup** | Sunday 11:59 PM | 300-500 words reflecting on sketch + critique |
| **Discussion** | Varies | In-class or async participation |

- Study quizzes = check you did the reading, not gotcha tests
- Writeups = this is Writing Intensive, writing quality matters
- Sketches = thinking tool, not art class

**ALSO - DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE CHECKLISTS!**
- You should definitely be continually reviewing these. For example they tell you what you need to do between this class and next weeks class (aka: the readings). This is the one place that tells you this; the single source of truth!

## Quick Check: Did You Do the Readings?

**PBS "How to Critique":**
- What does the video say is the MOST instructive part of critique - giving or receiving?
- Name one of the 5 guidelines from the video.

**Berkun article:**
- What's the "PNP sandwich"?
- Why should you "know the goals first" before critiquing?

## Reading Highlights

**PBS "How to Critique"**

The video says critique is MOST instructive for the person **giving** it - you learn by formulating your opinions into words.

*Wait — isn't feedback supposed to help the person receiving it?*

Yes, but think about it this way:
- **Receiving feedback** = learning about THIS project (specific, helpful, but narrow)
- **Giving feedback** = developing a SKILL you keep forever

When you give feedback, you have to articulate *why* something works or doesn't. That forces vague gut feelings into specific reasoning. You're training your critical eye — and that eye works on your own stuff too. Critique 4 sketches today, and you've practiced spotting UX issues 4 times. That adds up.

Receiving feedback improves *this project*. Giving feedback improves *you as a designer*.

**The 5 Guidelines:**
1. **Be Attentive** - look multiple times, opinion may change
2. **Don't Be Lazy** - say WHY, not just "interesting" or "I like it"
3. **Be Generous** - making takes courage, look for "aspects of wonder"
4. **Find Your Entry Point** - what does it remind you of? what decisions were made?
5. **Don't Be a Jerk** - pretend you're in the same room

> "Critique can be an incredible act of empathy."

**Berkun - Giving Feedback:**
- **Know the goals first** - what problem does this solve? (You can't critique if you don't know what it's trying to do)
- **Separate preference from quality** - your taste ≠ objective truth
- **PNP sandwich** - positive, then negative, then positive (formulaic but it works)

**Berkun - Receiving Feedback:**
- Listen without defending
- Ask clarifying questions
- "How would you fix it?"

## Demo: Let's Critique Mine First

*[JP shows two versions of a bedside lamp sketch]*

**Version A:** Just the lamps
**Version B:** Lamps + bed + person reaching awkwardly

Discussion:
- Which version communicates the UX problem better?
- What's missing from the simpler one?
- What would you add or change?

**Key point:** You're critiquing the **argument** (is this good/bad design?), not the **art** (nice shading!). The sketch is a communication tool.

---

## Critique Setup

**Form groups of 4-5**

**Remember:** You're critiquing whether the sketch communicates a clear UX argument - not whether it's pretty.

**Your job:**
- Show your two sketches (good design vs bad design object)
- Explain your choices
- Get feedback from the group
- Give feedback to others

**Take notes for your writeup:**

- Could they understand your sketch? Did it communicate the problem?
- Could they see the differences between good/bad design?
- What questions did they ask?
- What suggestions did they make?
- Could they read your labels?
- Did you feel personally criticized? (If so, why?)
- What did you notice about others' sketches?

---

## Critique Activity

Go!

---

## Debrief

- Any surprises?
- Anything hard about giving feedback?
- Anything hard about receiving it?

**Sneak peek:** In a few weeks, you'll revisit the same object and sketch it again — but with all the UX terminology and frameworks we'll learn between now and then. It'll be interesting to see how your critiques evolve.

---

## Writeup Reminder

**Due:** Sunday 11:59 PM

**What to write (300-500 words):**
- Why did you choose these two objects?
- What's good/bad about the experience of using them?
- What feedback did you get during critique?
- What did you notice about others' sketches?

**Important:** No AI for this one - we want YOUR voice as a writing baseline.
