## Discussion Points for Class

### What This Listing Reveals About Industry Roles

1. **Hybrid Role:** This position blends multiple disciplines:
   - UX Designer (wireframing, prototyping, user research)
   - UI Designer (visual design, iconography, graphic design)
   - UI Artist (creating actual assets)
   - Technical Designer (implementing in-engine with Blueprints)
   - Team Lead (mentoring, managing outsourcing)

2. **"Principal" Level:** This is a senior position (12+ years). Entry-level versions of this role would focus on fewer responsibilities.

3. **Industry-Specific Skills:** Note the heavy emphasis on:
   - Unreal Engine implementation
   - Multiplayer/shooter game experience
   - Working with outsource vendors (common in AAA)

4. **Remote-First:** Modern game studios increasingly support remote work, but still require some travel for team building.

### Questions to Consider

- Which responsibilities would an **entry-level** UI/UX designer handle?
- Why do game studios often **combine** UI and UX roles?
- What does "user-centered design" mean in a **multiplayer shooter** context?
- How does this differ from a **non-game** UI/UX designer role?
