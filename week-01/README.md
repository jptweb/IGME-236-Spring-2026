# Week 1: Job Listings

Real job listings from the game industry. Use these to see how companies actually define UX and UI roles — and how those definitions don't always match the textbook.

## The Listings

| Company | Role | Experience Level |
|---------|------|------------------|
| [Bad Robot Games](./job-listing-bad-robot-games.md) | Principal UI/UX Designer | Senior (12+ yrs) |
| [Activision Blizzard](./job-listing-activision-user-researcher.md) | User Researcher (Mobile) | Mid (3+ yrs) |
| [Naughty Dog](./job-listing-naughty-dog-user-researcher.md) | Senior User Researcher | Senior (5+ yrs) |
| [Paradoxum Games](./job-listing-paradoxum-games.md) | UI/UX Designer | Entry-level |
| [??? (Exercise)](./job-listing-EXERCISE-spot-the-issues.md) | UX Designer | — |

## Questions to Consider

As you read through these, think about:

1. **What's actually in the job?** Look past the title. What would you be doing day-to-day?

2. **UI vs UX:** Does the listing treat these as separate things, or blend them together? Which seems more emphasized?

3. **Research:** Does the role involve understanding users (interviews, testing, surveys)? Or is it purely about creating visuals?

4. **Tools vs Methods:** Are they asking for tools (Figma, Photoshop) or methods (usability testing, wireframing, prototyping)? What's the difference?

5. **Compare roles:** The Bad Robot listing requires 12+ years. The Paradoxum listing doesn't specify years. What's different about what they're asking for?

6. **Degrees mentioned:** Some listings mention specific degrees (Psychology, HCI, Human Factors). What does that tell you about what the job actually involves?

## The Exercise

One of these listings is fake. Can you tell which one — and what's wrong with it?
