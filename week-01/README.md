# Week 1: Job Listings

*Not a required assignment — just a fun activity if we have extra time in class or something to browse on your own.*

Real job listings from the game industry. Use these to see how companies actually define UX and UI roles — and how those definitions don't always match the textbook.

## The Listings

| Company | Role | Experience Level |
|---------|------|------------------|
| [Bad Robot Games](./job-listings/job-listing-bad-robot-games.md) | Principal UI/UX Designer | Senior (12+ yrs) |
| [Activision Blizzard](./job-listings/job-listing-activision-user-researcher.md) | User Researcher (Mobile) | Mid (3+ yrs) |
| [Naughty Dog](./job-listings/job-listing-naughty-dog-user-researcher.md) | Senior User Researcher | Senior (5+ yrs) |
| [Paradoxum Games](./job-listings/job-listing-paradoxum-games.md) | UI/UX Designer | Entry-level |
| [Fictional Example](./job-listings/job-listing-EXERCISE-spot-the-issues.md) | "UX Designer" | Red flags |

## Questions to Consider

As you read through these, think about:

1. **What's actually in the job?** Look past the title. What would you be doing day-to-day?

2. **UI vs UX:** Does the listing treat these as separate things, or blend them together? Which seems more emphasized?

3. **Research:** Does the role involve understanding users (interviews, testing, surveys)? Or is it purely about creating visuals?

4. **Tools vs Methods:** Are they asking for tools (Figma, Photoshop) or methods (usability testing, wireframing, prototyping)? What's the difference?

5. **Compare roles:** The Bad Robot listing requires 12+ years. The Paradoxum listing doesn't specify years. What's different about what they're asking for?

6. **Degrees mentioned:** Some listings mention specific degrees (Psychology, HCI, Human Factors). What does that tell you about what the job actually involves?

## Bonus: Spotting Red Flags

I couldn't find a real listing that perfectly illustrated a misdefined role, so I made one up. The [fictional listing](./job-listings/job-listing-EXERCISE-spot-the-issues.md) is an example of what a "red flag" job posting might look like. Knowing how to spot these is a useful skill when job hunting!

The title says "UX Designer" — but is that accurate? What would be a better title for what they're actually asking for?

## Also: Web Dev in Games

I also teach IGME 330 (Rich Media Web App Development), so I wanted to show how web dev skills translate to gaming careers. The AAA game dev market is tough right now, but companies like EA Pogo, King (Candy Crush), and Zynga hire web developers for gaming-adjacent roles. Your skills have options.

Check out this [EA Pogo - Full Stack Web Game Engineer](./job-listings/job-listing-ea-pogo-web-engineer.md) listing — it's for HTML5 browser games using JavaScript, React, and Node, the same stack you learn in 235/330/340.
