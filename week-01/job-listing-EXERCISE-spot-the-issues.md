## Discussion: What's Wrong With This Listing?

*(Reveal after students discuss)*

### Red Flags

1. **Title vs. Reality Mismatch**
   - Says "UX Designer" but describes a Visual/UI Designer or Graphic Designer role
   - Zero mention of: user research, usability testing, user flows, wireframing, prototyping, player feedback, personas, or any actual UX work

2. **"Make it look amazing" Focus**
   - UX is about how it *works*, not just how it *looks*
   - Phrases like "pixel-perfect," "beautiful," "gorgeous," "pretty things" = visual design, not UX

3. **Deliverables Are All Visual Assets**
   - Icons, buttons, promotional graphics, marketing materials
   - No mention of: user journey maps, wireframes, usability reports, A/B test results

4. **No Research or Testing Anywhere**
   - Real UX roles mention: user interviews, playtesting, surveys, analytics, heuristic evaluation
   - This listing treats players as viewers, not users to understand

5. **"Visual taste" as Key Qualification**
   - UX is evidence-based, not taste-based
   - Research findings > personal aesthetic preferences

6. **Suspiciously Low Salary**
   - $55-65k for "3+ years UX experience" is below market
   - They're paying for a graphic designer but asking for UX credentials

### What This Company Actually Needs

They should hire a **UI Artist** or **Visual Designer** — and that's fine! Those are real roles. The problem is mislabeling it "UX Designer" which:
- Attracts wrong candidates
- Signals the company doesn't understand UX
- May mean no one is doing actual UX work on the game

### Compare To Real UX Roles

Look at the Activision/Naughty Dog User Researcher listings:
- Required degrees: Psychology, HCI, Human Factors
- Methods: usability testing, playtesting, surveys, heuristic evaluation
- Deliverables: research findings, actionable recommendations

That's what actual UX work looks like.
