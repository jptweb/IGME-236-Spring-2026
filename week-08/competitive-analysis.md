# Week 8 Writeup: Competitive Analysis

You will conduct an initial analysis to explore existing solutions and competitors. This will help you understand the current landscape of solutions addressing the same or similar problems and provide insight into how your potential solution can differentiate itself.

## Step 1: Identify Competitors

Identify at least **2-3 existing solutions** that address your chosen problem or are related to the software you are redesigning. These could be apps, services, or technologies that solve the same or similar issues.

## Step 2: Analyze Each Solution

For each solution, conduct a competitive analysis focusing on:

- **Features:** What functionalities are offered?
- **User experience:** How easy or difficult is it for users to interact with the solution?
- **Strengths and weaknesses:** What does this solution do well, and where does it fall short?

## Step 3: Identify Gaps and Opportunities

Identify gaps or opportunities that your solution or redesign could target. What unmet needs or frustrations do users have that your solution could address?

**Examples:**

- If most mobile ordering apps are focused on large chain stores, there could be an opportunity to design a solution for smaller, independent coffee shops.
- For a Spotify redesign, a gap might be the lack of advanced playlist management tools, such as easier ways to sort or categorize songs.

## Step 4: Write It Up

Create a document summarizing your competitive analysis. Be sure to:

- List and describe 2-3 competitors
- Provide a comparison of features, user experience, and strengths/weaknesses
- Identify potential gaps or opportunities for your solution to stand out
