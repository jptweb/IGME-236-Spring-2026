## Sketch Discussion: Search Engine IA Comparison

You each sketched 2 search engines (landing page + results page). Now compare with your team.

**Walk through each person's sketches and discuss:**

1. **Which two engines did you pick?** Why?
2. **How do the landing pages differ in IA?** Think about organization, labeling, layout, navigation, and use of search. Which feels simpler? Which gives you more to browse?
3. **How do the results pages compare?** How is information organized? What labels are used? How many navigation options appear? Is there local navigation (tabs, filters, sidebar categories)?
4. **Where do you see IA principles at work?** Call out specific things — Dan Brown's 8 principles, the 5 components of IA (organization, labeling, navigation, search, layout), hierarchy, etc.
5. **Which engine does a better job overall?** Why? What would you change about the weaker one?

Take notes — this discussion feeds directly into your writeup.

## Week 7 Writeup — Search Engine IA Critique

**Due:** Sunday, Mar 1 at 11:59 PM

Using the same 2 search engines from your sketch, write a critique that covers:

1. **Individual Analysis** — Analyze and critique each search engine on its own. How does it handle organization, labeling, navigation, search, and layout? What works well? What doesn't?

2. **Compare & Contrast** — Include a section where you directly compare the two engines. Where do they make similar IA choices? Where do they diverge, and which approach is more effective?

**Guidelines**

- Reference **concrete examples** from the websites to support your claims (don't just say "the navigation is good" — point to specific elements and explain why)
- Back up your analysis with **principles and vocabulary from lectures** (this week and previous weeks)
- Include **supporting images** where they help illustrate your points
- Think of this writeup as a **stand-in for a presentation** — someone reading it without you there should be able to fully understand your analysis

**Deliverable:** A single PDF submitted to the myCourses dropbox by Sunday, Mar 1 at 11:59 PM.

## Prototype Project: Getting Started

Starting today, you'll be working with your team on a semester-long prototype project. The full project has several phases — here's what's coming up.

### Project Overview

Your team will either:
- **Identify a real user problem** and design a solution, or
- **Redesign an existing piece of software** by addressing user pain points

Full project details and all phase instructions: [Prototype Project Overview](../projects/README.md)

> These instructions are tentative and may be adjusted as we go.

### What's Due First: Project Proposal

**Due:** Monday, Mar 16, 11:59 PM (first day back from Spring Break)

Full instructions: [Phase 1 — Proposal](../projects/01-proposal.md)

**Quick summary of what the proposal needs:**
- **Problem Statement or Redesign Focus** — What are you solving or redesigning?
- **Target Users** — Who are they and how are they affected?
- **Task Flows** — Each team member creates one task flow showing the *current* user experience (with pain points identified). Think of this as investigative UX research — map reality before redesigning it.
- **Initial Ideas** — High-level overview of how you plan to address the problem

**Scope check** — your project should be specific, user-centered, interaction-focused, and prototype-able within the semester. Read the full scope guidelines in the proposal instructions.

**Required prep:** Watch **[Interaction Design: Flow](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/interaction-design-flow/the-power-of-flow-in-interaction-design?u=42272537)** on LinkedIn Learning (29 minutes) before creating your task flows.

**AI policy:** AI can help polish your writing, but the problem definition, task flows, pain points, and solution ideas must come from your team. See the full AI expectations in the proposal instructions.

### What to Talk About Today

Use the remaining class time to start these conversations with your team:

1. **Introductions** — What are each person's strengths? (Visual design, writing, research, technical?)
2. **Brainstorm project direction** — What problems or software are you interested in tackling? Think about your Slack pain point discussions from earlier weeks.
3. **Narrow it down** — Can you agree on a general direction today? You don't need to finalize, but having a rough idea lets you start thinking over the next week.
4. **Who are your users?** — Start thinking about who experiences this problem. Be specific.
