# Week 4 Day 2: Critique + Flow Reflections

> **About these notes:** Day 1 each week will typically have polished slides with graphics and videos. Day 2 I'll throw together a markdown document covering anything I didn't explain well, ran out of time for, or want to emphasize before you dive into activities.
>
> This doesn't replace your myCourses checklist — that's your authoritative to-do list. This is just a quick guide for what we're working through today.

## Flow: Quick Reference

You watched the Csikszentmihalyi TED talk and Jenova Chen's work. Here's the vocabulary to keep handy:

**Five key conditions for flow:**
1. Intrinsically motivating
2. Clear goals
3. Clear and immediate feedback
4. Challenge matches skill (personal control and agency)
5. Intense focus in the present moment

**The flow channel** — where challenge and skill are both above your personal average:

| State | Challenge vs. Skill |
|-------|---------------------|
| **Flow** | High challenge + High skill |
| **Arousal** | High challenge + Medium skill (learning zone) |
| **Control** | Medium challenge + High skill (comfortable) |
| **Boredom** | Low challenge + High skill |
| **Apathy** | Low challenge + Low skill |

**Remember:** Not every condition needs to be present for flow. And flow isn't just games — it applies to any activity.

## Group Time: Two Topics, One Conversation

I'll put you into small groups of about 3-4. You'll stay in these groups for both discussions. Have your sketchbook (or digital sketches) ready and a way to take notes.

### Topic 1: Sketch Critique

Walk through each person's two objects (good vs. less effective emotional design):

- Use the vocabulary: **visceral**, **behavioral**, **reflective**
- Don't just say "I like it" — identify which *level* of emotional design is working (or not) and why
- Consider: Could an object be strong at one level and weak at another?
- Notice: Was it different this time since you were potentially talking about things that were emotionally important to **you** that perhaps were not emotionally important to **them**?

Take notes on what people said about your objects and sketches — you'll want these for your writeup.

### Topic 2: Flow Experiences

Think about a recent experience where you believe you were in a **flow state**. It could be working on a coding project, playing a competitive game, creating something (music, art, a 3D model), rock climbing, cooking a complex meal, playing in a band — anything where you lost track of time because you were deeply engaged.

Share with your group and discuss:
- What made the experience engaging?
- Did you experience time distortion?
- Was there a balance between challenge and skill?
- What about it aligns with the flow state descriptions from the readings and videos?

## Individual Submission: Flow State Reflections

**Due Friday 11:59 PM** (if not finished in class) | **No AI**

After your group discussion, write a brief (one paragraph) description of your flow experience and identify **at least 3 specific aspects** that contributed to the sense of flow. Use vocabulary from the readings (e.g., challenge-skill balance, clear goals, immediate feedback, loss of self-consciousness, transformation of time).

Paste your paragraph into the assignment text box on myCourses to submit.

## Writeup Reminder (Due Sunday)

**Week 4 Writeup — Emotional Design** | 300-500 words | Due Sunday 11:59 PM

Compare your two sketched objects in terms of visceral, behavioral, and reflective emotional design. See myCourses for full instructions and AI policy.

## Norman Chapter 3

I shared a PDF of Norman's *Emotional Design* Chapter 3 (the visceral/behavioral/reflective breakdown). It's not required reading, but if you want more depth for your writeup, it's a great resource. Check myCourses Resources.

## Looking Ahead: Week 5

The Week 5 readings are already available in the Week 5 content folder on myCourses. The study quiz, checklist, and remaining materials will be published by Friday afternoon — but if you want a head start on the readings, they're there now.

## Before Next Week

- [ ] Submit flow reflections exercise (Friday 11:59 PM)
- [ ] Week 4 Writeup (Sunday 11:59 PM)
- [ ] Week 5 readings + Study Quiz (before Tuesday)
