## Course Description

This course introduces students to the principles of User Experience (UX) design as applied to games and interactive media. Students will learn to analyze, critique, and design interfaces that are usable, engaging, and effective.

### Course Goals
1. **Primary:** Introduce UX (User Experience) concepts and vocabulary
2. **Secondary:** Build communication skills (visual, verbal, written)

### Writing Intensive Course

**This course is designated as Writing Intensive (WI) by RIT.** This is not optional - it's part of the course accreditation.

What this means for you:
- Your writing will be evaluated on **clarity, organization, and professionalism** - not just content
- Stringing together a few poorly written sentences will not earn full credit
- You are expected to produce **thoughtful, insightful analysis** that demonstrates understanding of UX concepts
- Proofread your work. Use tools like Grammarly if helpful.
- See **Generative AI Policy** below for expectations around AI tool usage.

The good news: the 300-500 word limit keeps assignments focused. Quality over quantity.

### Generative AI Policy

You may use generative AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, etc.) to assist with your work in this course, with the following requirements:

1. **The ideas and analysis must be your own.** AI can help you polish grammar, clarify phrasing, or organize thoughts - but YOU must do the thinking. Write first, then use AI to edit if helpful.

2. **Disclosure is required.** If you use AI tools in any capacity beyond basic spell-check, you must disclose this at the end of your submission. A simple note like "Used ChatGPT for grammar editing" is sufficient.

3. **Failure to disclose AI use is academic dishonesty.** Using AI without disclosure is equivalent to having someone else do your work and claiming it as your own. This will be treated as an academic integrity violation.

4. **AI cannot replace the learning.** Submitting AI-generated content without genuine engagement defeats the purpose of this Writing Intensive course. If your writing doesn't demonstrate understanding of UX concepts, it won't earn full credit regardless of how polished it sounds.

**Why this policy?** AI tools are increasingly part of professional workflows. Learning to use them responsibly - as assistants rather than replacements for your own thinking - is a valuable skill. But transparency is non-negotiable.

### Description of Components

**Short Writing Assignments** *(done outside class)*

Throughout the semester, you will be completing short (300-500 word) writing assignments.

During the first half of the class, these will be based on sketches that you do before class and then bring to class for critiques (that portion falls under in-class activities). Following the peer critique, you'll write an analysis of the interfaces you sketched, taking into account any feedback you received in class. To get full credit, you will need to apply concepts from lecture and the readings to explain what made the interfaces particularly good or bad, as well as including some of the feedback you received from your group members.

In your writeups, try to avoid focusing on what you personally like and dislike about the items you sketched. Instead, focus on the differences in design choices, and what impact they have on the item's interface. Consider whether different audiences might find the interface of one better than the other. Keep in mind the mantra for this class: **"You are not the user!"**

Later in the semester, your writing assignments will be focused on aspects of the prototype project.

**Study Quizzes** *(done outside class)*

These are relatively simple, low-pressure quizzes about the readings and perhaps some topics from the previous week that you should know before arriving to the upcoming week's lecture.

All of the readings and materials in this course are important. We have gathered a bunch of important references to help you get up to speed in the world of UX over the course of 15 weeks. Which is nice, so you don't need to go exploring and find them yourself! Being familiar with these materials is essential to building a foundation of theory in your mind, so we can go practice and build our skills later.

So prove you are keeping up with the readings by doing some short myCourses quizzes. You can take these multiple times if you like until you achieve a score that you're happy with.

**In-Class Activities** *(only component requiring attendance)*

There will be frequent in-class activities, ranging from critiquing each others' work to interviewing other students. Most (but not all) of these activities can be made up if you miss class - assuming you submit an absence request before class and arrange a makeup with me.

There will be a number of weeks where you'll be asked to compare and contrast two different items or activities in your writing assignment. Those weeks you'll discuss your ideas with a group in class, and then sketch the items. Sketches should be hand-drawn, either in a paper notebook or using a digital sketching tool. (You can find decent quality sketchbooks for low prices ($4-6) at Walmart or on Amazon, or as much as $20-30 for a Moleskine-brand notebook.) These are meant to be sketches, not mockups, so do not use photographs or create computer-based models. I've provided some resources to help you learn how to effectively sketch prototypes in the content section of myCourses.

**Interactive Prototype**

During the second half of the semester, you will be working with a group to design and implement an interactive prototype. All of the groups will be working on revisions of the same interface. The project has four group deliverables and one individual deliverable. Your group will submit an initial proposal, a lo-fi prototype, a final prototype, and a video walkthrough. You will each write a final individual document reflecting on the project, as well as critiquing your own work and that of the other members of your group.

## Navigating myCourses

Each week has its own folder in the Content area. Here's how they're organized:

```
Week X: [Topic]
├── Week X Checklist             ← Start here! Your to-do list for the week
├── [Lecture Slides]             ← Link + PDF versions
├── Assignments/                 ← Study Quiz, Sketches, Writeup, In-Class Exercises
├── Readings/Watchings/          ← REQUIRED: Study Quiz is based on these
└── Resources/                   ← Optional but recommended extras
```

**Key distinction:**
- **Readings/Watchings folder** = Required. Complete these BEFORE Tuesday's class. The Study Quiz (in Assignments) tests this material.
- **Resources folder** = Strongly recommended but not quizzed. Skim these to deepen your understanding and help with assignments.
- **Assignments folder** = Where you submit work and take quizzes.

---

## Schedule & Due Dates

- **Tuesdays:** Readings & Study Quizzes due before class
- **Thursdays:** Weekly sketches due before class (bring to critique)
- **Sundays:** Writing assignments due 11:59 PM

### Rewrites
Writing assignments may be revised **once** based on feedback.

**Requirements:**
- You must submit the original on time (late originals are not eligible for rewrite)
- Rewrites are due **one week after receiving feedback**
- Submit rewrites to the **"Writing Rewrites" dropbox** (not the original dropbox)
- Use this naming convention: `WeekX-Writeup-Rewrite-LastName.docx`
  - Example: `Week3-Writeup-Rewrite-Smith.docx`

**Important:** The Writing Rewrites dropbox is ONLY for revisions after feedback. It is NOT for late submissions. Late work submitted here will receive a zero.

### Turnitin
Writing assignments are submitted through Turnitin, which checks for similarity to other sources and flags potential AI-generated content. This is being trialed this semester.

**What this means for you:**
- You can view your Similarity Report after submitting
- High similarity isn't automatically bad (quotes, common phrases) - but review it
- AI detection is included, though it's not perfect
- **The goal is transparency, not gotcha.** If you used AI tools appropriately per the course policy, just disclose it. Undisclosed AI use that gets flagged will be treated as academic dishonesty.

## Attendance & Absences

There is no attendance grade, but many graded activities occur in class (25% of your grade).

### If You Must Miss Class

1. **Submit an absence request via Slack workflow BEFORE class**
   - This helps me track absences and keeps you accountable
   - Requests submitted after class may not be accepted

2. **Arrange your own makeup**
   - An excused absence does not automatically mean makeup work
   - It is YOUR responsibility to contact me (office hours, Slack DM) to discuss alternatives
   - I will do my best to accommodate, but some activities cannot be replicated outside class

3. **Unexcused absences = zero for in-class work**

### A Note on Frequency
Life happens, and I understand. However, if absence requests become frequent, I may need to have a conversation about your ability to succeed in the course. The in-class activities are designed to build skills through peer interaction - missing too many diminishes that experience.

*Please do not come to class sick! Use the Slack workflow and we'll figure it out.*

## Late Work

**Best option:** Request an extension via Slack DM **before noon on the due date**. Extensions are usually granted if you communicate proactively.

**No extension requested:**

| Work Type | Late Penalty |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Writeups & standalone assignments** | -10% per day, up to 2 days late. After 48 hours → zero. |
| **Sketches** (needed for Thursday critique) | No late submissions. Without your sketch, you cannot participate in the critique activity. |
| **Quizzes** | No late submissions (unlimited retakes available before deadline). |
| **Group project deliverables** | No late submissions without prior approval from instructor. |

**Why the distinction?** Sketches feed directly into Thursday's in-class critique - if you don't have them, you can't meaningfully participate. Writeups are more standalone, so a sliding penalty makes sense. Group work affects your teammates, so plan ahead.

### Student Support Availability

Success in this course depends heavily on your personal health and wellbeing. Recognize that stress is an expected part of the college experience, and it often can be compounded by unexpected setbacks or life changes outside the classroom. Your other instructors and I strongly encourage you to reframe challenges as an unavoidable pathway to success. Reflect on your role in taking care of yourself throughout the term, before the demands of exams and projects reach their peak. Please feel free to reach out to me about any difficulty you may be having that may impact your performance in this course as soon as it occurs and before it becomes unmanageable.

In addition to your academic advisor, I strongly encourage you to contact the many other support services on campus that stand ready to assist you. These include the Academic Success Center, College Restoration Program, Disability Services, English Language Center, Higher Education Opportunity Program, Spectrum Support program, and TRiO Support Services.

### Statement on Title IX

RIT is committed to providing a safe learning environment, free of harassment and discrimination as articulated in our university policies located on our governance website. RIT's policies require faculty to share information about incidents of gender based discrimination and harassment with RIT's Title IX coordinator or deputy coordinators when incidents are stated to them directly. The information you provide to a non-confidential resource which includes faculty will be relayed only as necessary for the Title IX Coordinator to investigate and/or seek resolution. Even RIT Offices and employees who cannot guarantee confidentiality will maintain your privacy to the greatest extent possible.

If an individual discloses information during a public awareness event, a protest, during a class project, or advocacy event, RIT is not obligated to investigate based on this public disclosure. RIT may however use this information to further educate faculty, staff and students about prevention efforts and available resources.

If you would like to report an incident of gender based discrimination or harassment directly you may do so by using the online Sexual Harassment, Discrimination and Sexual Misconduct Reporting or anonymously by using the Compliance and Ethics Hotline.

If you have a concern related to gender-based discrimination and/or harassment and prefer to have a confidential discussion, assistance is available from any of RIT's confidential resources (listed below).
