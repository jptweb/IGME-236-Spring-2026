# Tips on Sketches & Writeups

*Plus video tips from various IGM instructors*

## Choosing Items to Compare

Within the context of each week's guidelines, try to choose two items that are:
- **Very similar in type and use** — same category, same purpose
- **Different in design** — enough variation to impact user experience

**Good examples:**
- Two different sets of polyhedral dice
- Two Xbox controllers (different generations or editions)
- Two coffee mugs with different handle designs

This approach makes it easier to identify meaningful design differences rather than comparing apples to oranges.

## Sketches

**Use real items, not imagined ones.** You'll get to design improved interfaces in other activities — for sketches, focus on things that exist in the real world.

**Ideally, choose items you've personally used.** That said, you don't need to have them in front of you. Reference images from online are fine to help with your sketches.

**Label key areas of difference.** Your sketches don't need to include every detail about good and bad design aspects, but highlighting the important differences helps others focus during critique.

### Hand-Drawn Required (But Digital is OK!)

The key requirement is **hand-drawn** — your sketches need to come from your hand, not a computer.

**Acceptable:**
- Paper sketchbook + pencil/pen (the classic)
- iPad/tablet + stylus (Procreate, Notability, etc.)
- Wacom tablet or similar

**Not acceptable:**
- Screenshots or photos of the items
- Figma/Sketch/Adobe XD mockups
- AI-generated images
- Tracing with shape tools

**Why hand-drawn?** Sketching forces you to focus on what matters. When you draw something, you have to decide what to include and what to leave out. Photos capture everything; sketches capture your *understanding*. That's the point.

**Don't worry about artistic skill.** These are sketches, not portfolio pieces. If someone can tell what you drew and read your labels, you're good.

## Writeups

**Focus on design differences, not personal preferences.**

Consider how design choices impact different users and contexts. Remember the mantra: **"You are not the user!"**

**Example:** Two students both compared a wooden pencil to a mechanical pencil. One concluded the wooden pencil was better; the other said the mechanical pencil was clearly superior. Who was right?

*Neither — and both.* It depends on the user:
- **Artists** may prefer wooden pencils for shading flexibility
- **Writers or drafters** may prefer mechanical pencils for consistent point sharpness

**Sometimes design IS clearly better or worse.** If a design significantly interferes with the item's intended use, that's a real problem worth calling out. But often, design differences simply reflect different use cases.

**Apply concepts correctly.** If you've been given a specific UX concept to focus on (affordances, feedback, mental models, etc.), make sure you understand it before writing. If you're unsure, ask! Post in Slack or come to office hours.

## Video Tips from IGM Instructors

*Note from Prof Takats: As I'm new to teaching this class, I don't have my own tip videos yet. But I found a couple from other instructors that are worth watching. You don't need to watch both, but each offers a unique perspective.*

### 1. Dr. D. Ayman Shamma (Fall 2020)

Recorded for his IGME-236 class:

### 2. Nick Buonarota (Lab Tips Series)

Nick has taught this class many times and developed these videos during COVID. The assignments and modality may differ slightly from what we do, but the content is solid:

*I may share more of Nick's lab tip videos throughout the semester as I develop my own material.*
