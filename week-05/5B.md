# Week 5 Day 2: Critique + Pain Points

> **About these notes:** Day 1 each week will typically have polished slides with graphics and videos. Day 2 I'll throw together a markdown document covering anything I didn't explain well, ran out of time for, or want to emphasize before you dive into activities.
>
> This doesn't replace your myCourses checklist. That's your authoritative to-do list. This is just a quick guide for what we're working through today.

## Activity: Find the Welding Gloves

We're going to try a quick task on two different hardware supply websites.

**The task:** Find welding gloves using only the site's navigation. **No search bar.**

- **Round 1:** 2-3 minutes
- **Round 2:** 2-3 minutes

Note how long it takes, or whether you can find them at all.

## Debrief: Efficiency = Speed + Fewer Mistakes

> "Any user experience effort aims to improve efficiency. This basically comes in two key forms: helping people work faster and helping them make fewer mistakes."
> *Garrett, The Elements of User Experience, p. 34*

- Which site helped you **work faster**? Why?
- Which site helped you **make fewer mistakes**? Why?
- Which of Garrett's **five planes** explains the difference?

## Common Types of UX Pain Points

Keep these categories in mind as we discuss today:

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| **Process/Workflow** | Complex flows, unclear next steps, no progress indicators |
| **Technical/Functional** | Slow performance, bugs, broken features, poor mobile optimization |
| **Usability/Design** | Confusing interface, hard-to-find info, poor error handling |
| **Support/Information** | Can't find help, unclear instructions |
| **Financial** | Hidden costs, unclear pricing |

**Think about which plane each pain point comes from.** A pain point isn't just a surface-level annoyance. It usually traces back to a decision (or a missing decision) at one of Garrett's planes.

## Group Time: Sketch Critique

Get into your groups. Have your sketches ready (both physical and digital versions).

**For each person's sketches, work through these prompts:**

1. **Show & Tell.** Walk through your two objects. What happened? What was the experience failure?
2. **Get Specific.** Don't just say "it didn't work." What exactly about the design caused the problem? Think about how Garrett describes the coffeemaker button lacking feedback.
3. **Name the Plane.** Which of Garrett's five planes does the problem mostly live on?
4. **The Fix.** How does your second object address the problem? What changed?
5. **Push Back.** Do you agree with where they placed it? Could the issue also trace to a different plane?

### Example: What a Good Critique Sounds Like

Imagine someone sketched Garrett's coffeemaker as their "negative experience" object. Here's how the prompts might play out:

**Show & Tell:** "My first object is a coffeemaker. I pressed the power button before bed so it would be ready in the morning, but I woke up to no coffee. The button didn't actually engage. I hadn't pushed it down far enough. My second sketch is a coffeemaker that has an indicator light and a confirmation beep when it powers on."

**Get Specific:** "The button gives you zero feedback. No light comes on, no sound, no click or resistance when it makes contact. So I *thought* I turned it on, but I was wrong. And there's actually a second failure: the thing has a programmable auto-brew timer that would have avoided the whole problem, but the display is just blinking 12:00. I didn't even know the timer feature existed because the interface never surfaced it."

**Name the Plane:** "I'd say Skeleton. The interface doesn't communicate the machine's state. There's no indicator light, no feedback on the button. The information design is failing."

**Push Back:** "But wait, is the missing indicator light really a Skeleton problem? Skeleton is about *where things go* on the interface. The decision to *not include* a status light at all feels more like Scope. They left that feature out of the product requirements. And the auto-brew timer being undiscoverable? That might be Structure, since the interaction design doesn't guide you toward that feature."

**The Fix:** "My second coffeemaker has an LED that lights up when powered on, an audible beep when brewing starts, and an auto-brew interface with labeled buttons instead of a blinking 12:00. It solves the Skeleton problem (visible state) and the Structure problem (the timer is discoverable and learnable)."

Notice how the conversation went deeper than "the coffeemaker was bad." They identified *two separate failures* (the button feedback AND the hidden timer), debated which planes were involved, and described how specific design changes in the second object address each one. That's the level of thinking you want.

Take notes on the feedback you receive. You'll want these for your writeup.

## Pain Points Discussion

After your sketch critique, shift to discussing UX pain points.

Think about an application (web, desktop, or mobile) that you personally use regularly and that has one or more **pain points**: parts of the interaction that regularly frustrate you. Don't just say "it's annoying." Try to identify the nature of the problem. What specifically goes wrong? Which UX concepts from the course help explain why?

### In Class

1. **Discuss.** Each person shares an app and a pain point with their group. Ask questions, compare experiences, help each other identify what's actually going wrong.
2. **Pick one.** As a group, agree on one pain point that you find most interesting or significant. It can come from any group member's example.
3. **Signal.** When your group has agreed on your pick, raise your hand. I'll come by to hear it and ask a few follow-up questions.

### After Class (by Friday 11:59 PM)

4. **Post to Slack.** Each person posts their **own individual** pain point to **#236-pain-points**. One person from your group may reuse the group's pick, but not everyone. Decide among yourselves who gets to keep it. Everyone else posts a different one. (You can also all post new ones if you prefer.) Include:
   - The app and what you were trying to do
   - What specifically frustrated you
   - What UX concepts help explain the problem (pain point type, which plane, relevant vocabulary from the course)
5. **React and reply.** Look through the other posts over the next few days. If you've experienced the same problem, give it an emoji reaction. If you have something to add (including disagreements), use "Reply in thread."
6. **Submit the link.** On myCourses, submit a link directly to your Slack post. To get the link: find your post, right-click the timestamp next to your name, and select "Copy Link."

### Why This Matters

Based on the pain points identified in this discussion, I'll decide what interaction redesign options to provide for your group prototype project. A range of good, specific examples is in your best interest.

### AI Policy for This Activity

AI use is **not permitted** for this discussion or Slack post. The problems you describe, the contributing factors you identify, and the design language you apply must come from your own observations and group discussion. You may refer to course slides and notes for terminology.

## Writeup: Week 5, Overall UX

**Due Sunday 11:59 PM** | **300-500 words** | See myCourses for submission

In your writeup, use any of the topics we've discussed to assess what exactly it was about the design of the thing you chose that made the experience a poor one.

**Be specific.** Don't just tell me "it didn't work well." Identify, as specifically as possible, what contributed to the negative experience. Use the level of detail that Garrett provides in describing both the problem and the underlying cause. Then explain how your second item would have addressed it.

### Process Requirement: A Mixing of Mediums

Include an **inline image** that reinforces or highlights a point made in your writeup.

- **Don't** just include your original sketches. Find or create some other image that adds to your discussion.
- This image could illustrate a point, show an alternative, be a conceptual solution, show examples of other products, etc.
- **Caption the image** so we know why you included it.
- The image may be AI-generated (see AI policy below).

### AI Expectations

AI use for this assignment is **limited and optional.**

**You may use AI to:**
- Support writing feedback and revision (clarity, organization, tone, grammar)
- Help locate or create an inline image that reinforces a point in your writeup

**AI may not be used to:**
- Generate the experience, scenario, or usability breakdown you're analyzing
- Identify or explain the design issues on your behalf
- Produce the core analysis, comparisons, or conclusions

Your written assessment must reflect your own observations and reasoning. If you use AI, include a brief acknowledgment at the end describing how it was used. If you used it to generate your inline image, include your image generation prompt.
