# Prototype Project: Reflections and Peer Evaluations

> **This is an individual submission.**

This should be written in **narrative form**, not as a list of bulleted points — because this is actually a writing-intensive class!

> **Note:** If you criticize your own project, it will not affect your project grade! I'll be reading these after the projects are graded. I'd much prefer that you be honest.

You should not focus on the contributions (or lack thereof) from specific group members in Sections 1 or 2 — you'll have a chance to do that in Section 3. Instead, focus on the group as a whole and how the experience design process went.

## Section 1: Reflections on Process

How do you think you and your group did in terms of the design process? That includes communicating with each other, identifying problems and pain points, breaking the project up into tasks, testing your ideas, determining an overall design strategy, and implementing the prototype. What could have been helpful to your group during the project?

## Section 2: Reflections on Product

Are you happy with your final prototype? What aspects of the prototype do you think were particularly well-implemented? Which were more problematic? In retrospect, would you have scoped or broken down the project differently? If so, how? If you had another semester to work on this, what would you do differently, and/or add, in order to make this the best possible prototype?

## Section 3: Group Performance

List each member of your group, including yourself. For each person, answer the following questions:

1. How involved were they in the project work?
2. How valuable was their contribution?
3. If there were problems related to their work, how did you and/or your group attempt to correct the problems?
4. Give a score from **0-100** for their participation, and another for the quality of their work.
5. Share anything else you think is important. (If you think your peers will give you low marks, use this section to provide an explanation as to why you think that is, and what you think you could have done differently to prevent it.)
