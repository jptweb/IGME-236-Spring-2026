# Prototype Project: Design System

Using both the [Design System Checklist](https://www.designsystemchecklist.com/) and the [Branding Style Guidelines Archive](https://brandingstyleguides.com/) as references, you will be documenting your own Design System.

## 1. Establishing the Design Language

### Define Vision and Design Principles

- Articulate the vision for the design system, describing the purpose, goals, and how the system will serve the users.
- Establish design principles that will guide your design decisions (e.g., simplicity, accessibility, clarity).

### Set Tone and Terminology

- Define the tone (e.g., friendly, professional, playful) that reflects the brand or product personality.
- Include a terminology guide to ensure consistency in wording, labels, and instructions across the interface.

## 2. Guidelines and Foundations

### Define Key Visual Elements

Develop a foundation for your design system that includes:

- **Color Palette:** Primary, secondary, accent, and neutral colors with guidelines for usage.
- **Typography:** Font families, sizes, weights, and spacing for headings, body text, buttons, and other text elements.
- **Layout and Spacing:** Consistent padding, margins, and alignment to create structure across the design.
- **Iconography:** Standard sizes, styles, and usage for icons that align with the design language.

### Document Each Element

Provide clear guidelines and visual examples for each foundational element, noting where and how each should be used in the interface.

## 3. Core Components and Patterns

### Define Key UI Components

Create a library of core components, including examples and guidelines for any components that will be used throughout the design. These are things such as:

- **Buttons:** Primary, secondary, and disabled states.
- **Menus and Navigation:** Styles for menus, nav bars, tabs, and other navigation elements.
- **Alerts and Modals:** Styles and usage for alerts, error messages, and modals.
- **Lists and Dropdowns:** Consistent layouts for list items, dropdowns, and selection menus.

And any other components that are essential to the overall design of your software.

### Outline Best Practices and Use Cases

Document best practices for using each component and provide specific use cases for when and how to implement them.

## 4. Overall Best Practices and Accessibility Considerations

Outline best practices for achieving consistency, usability, and accessibility across the design. This should include, but is not limited to:

- **Accessibility Guidelines:** Ensure contrast, font size, and screen reader compatibility.
- **Responsiveness and Scaling:** Guidelines for how components should adjust to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile). *You won't be expected to implement this for the final prototype, but it's important to consider when designing interfaces.*
- **General Best Practices:** Suggestions for creating a clean, intuitive, and engaging user interface.

## 5. Apply the Design System

Select **two core screens** from your prototype and apply the design system to create high-fidelity static mockups. These mockups should demonstrate:

- Consistent use of colors, typography, layout, and components.
- Adherence to the tone, design principles, and visual style defined in your design system.

## Deliverable

Submit the Design System Document with the mockups included at the end to the myCourses dropbox.
