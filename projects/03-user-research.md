# Prototype Project: User Research

Now it's time to execute the research you planned. You will conduct interviews, observe users, gather survey data, and reflect on whether your initial hypotheses hold up.

## 1. Conducting User Interviews

You will conduct interviews with participants from your target user group using the interview script you previously drafted. The goal is to gather detailed insights about their experiences, frustrations, and preferences.

**Step 1: Prepare for the interviews**
- Review your interview script and ensure all team members are familiar with the questions.
- Schedule and conduct interviews with at least **3-5 participants** from your target user group.
- Record the interviews (with permission) or take detailed notes.

**Step 2: Gather user insights**
- After each interview, summarize the key points and insights from the conversation.
- Focus on understanding the specific problems and pain points the users face.

**Deliverable:** A summary of your user interviews (~1 page per interview), highlighting key insights, pain points, and any notable feedback.

## 2. User Observations

You will observe users performing tasks related to the problems you've identified (or software you are redesigning) with the existing interface/software, note any pain points, and identify areas for improvement.

**Step 1: Plan your observations**
- Using the tasks identified in the initial proposal, you will observe users performing said tasks.
- Decide whether to observe users in person or via screen sharing/recorded sessions (if applicable).

**Step 2: Conduct the observations**
- Conduct observations with at least **3-5 participants** performing each of the relevant tasks.
- Observe how users approach and complete the tasks.
- Take detailed notes on what they do intuitively, where they struggle, and any moments of confusion or frustration.

**Deliverable:** A user observation report (~1-2 pages) summarizing your observations, including:
- Each task observed
- Pain points or challenges users encountered
- Any surprising behaviors or insights gained from watching users

## 3. Survey Results

In addition to interviews and observations, you will also gather quantitative data through the survey you designed earlier.

**Step 1: Distribute your survey**
- Aim to gather at least **10-15 survey responses** to ensure meaningful data.
- You may distribute the survey through email, social media, or other appropriate channels.

**Step 2: Analyze the results**
- Summarize key findings from the survey, focusing on trends or patterns in the data.
- Highlight any insights that align with or contradict your initial hypothesis.

**Deliverable:** A summary of your survey results (~1-2 pages), including charts or tables as necessary to present your findings clearly.

## 4. Reflection on Initial Hypotheses

After conducting your interviews, observations, and survey, reflect on whether your initial hypotheses about the problem or software were accurate.

**Step 1: Review your initial assumptions**
- Compare the feedback and insights from the interviews, observations, and survey results with your initial hypothesis.
- Were the pain points you initially predicted correct?
- Did you discover any new problems or unexpected user behavior?

**Step 2: Reflect on necessary changes**
- If your hypothesis needs to be amended, explain why and how.
- If your hypothesis was correct, provide evidence from your research that supports your assumptions.

**Deliverable:** A reflection report (~1-2 pages) that includes:
- A comparison of your initial assumptions with the findings from the interviews, observations, and surveys
- A reflection on whether your initial hypothesis needs to be amended or refined

## Final Deliverable

Combine the deliverables from each part into **one document** and submit to the myCourses dropbox.
