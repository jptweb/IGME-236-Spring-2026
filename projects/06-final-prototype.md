# Prototype Project: Final Prototype

Your final prototype will be a cohesive high-fidelity prototype. It should simulate the process of using the software, and its appearance, as closely as possible. It should incorporate any changes that your lo-fi version indicated were necessary.

## Requirements

- The prototype should demonstrate **each task flow** (one for each team member), consistent with the design system created.
- The prototype should be **fully functional and visually polished**.
- At a minimum, your prototype should include any screens on which you are modifying content, and any screens that might display if someone chose the wrong option while trying to accomplish the given task.
- If you're not clear on what this means in the context of your project, please let us know.

## Testing

It is in your best interest to test your prototype with people from your intended user group, and to modify the prototype as needed based on those tests before turning in the final version.

Be sure to test your prototype before submitting. If I encounter significant problems with accomplishing the given tasks using your prototype, that will be a strong signal that you did not appropriately test the prototype before turning it in.

## Deliverable

Submit a **link to your high-fidelity prototype** and a **list of each of the user tasks** that have been addressed within the prototype.
