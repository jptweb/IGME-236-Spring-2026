# Prototype Project: User Research Prep

Using your team's proposal as a starting point, prepare the groundwork for user research. You will conduct a competitive analysis (background research), draft an interview script and survey, and plan your research participants.

## Background Research

> **Note:** You may have already done this for your Week 6 writeup — if you are still working on the same topic. If not, briefly gather this information again as part of this assignment.

Determine whether other people have actually had the problems your team has described. You can do this by:

- Reading customer forums on the vendor's site
- Reading through relevant Reddit forums
- Reading reviews of the product or similar products
- Doing a Google search with an appropriate query (ask for help if you're not sure what a good query would be)

**Summarize your findings for each problem:** Is this a common problem? Is there a specific user group that seems to encounter the problem more than others?

## Step 1: Draft the Interview Script

Create a set of **5-10 open-ended interview questions** designed to elicit detailed responses from your target users. Focus on understanding their needs, frustrations, and experiences related to the problem or the software you're redesigning.

Include an **introduction** to explain to the interviewee what the interview will be about and why their feedback is important. The introduction should be brief, providing context about the project and setting expectations for the interview.

**Tips for crafting interview questions:**
- Avoid yes/no questions
- Ask about specific user experiences
- Keep the questions conversational and easy to understand

**Example interview questions:**
- "Can you describe your typical experience when ordering coffee in the morning?"
- "What frustrates you the most when using your music app to create playlists?"
- "How often do you face challenges finding songs in large playlists?"

## Step 2: Draft the Survey

Create a survey with **5-7 questions** to gather quantitative data. Use a mix of multiple-choice, rating scales (e.g., 1-5), and open-ended questions to capture a broader range of responses.

**Survey question types:**
- **Multiple-choice:** "How often do you use a mobile app to order coffee?"
- **Likert Scale:** "How satisfied are you with your current playlist management tools?" (Very Satisfied – Not Satisfied – etc.)
- **Open-ended:** "What do you find most challenging about managing playlists?"

## Step 3: Plan Your Research

Decide who you will interview and survey. Aim to gather data from at least **5-10 participants** in your target user group. These should be users who are affected by the problem or who use the software you're redesigning.

> **Note:** This is still just a plan — you don't need to conduct the interviews yet. You will be conducting interviews in the next stage of the project.

## Deliverable

Submit a single document containing your background research summaries (may have been previously created), interview script (5-10 questions), survey (5-7 questions), and research plan.
