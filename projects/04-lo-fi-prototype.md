# Prototype Project: Lo-Fi Prototype

Now that you've done your user research, create a low-fidelity prototype of your solution and conduct preliminary user testing to gather feedback.

## 1. Developing the Low-Fi Prototype

### Step 1: Define core features and layout

- Based on your findings, decide on the core features your prototype should include. Focus on essential elements that will allow users to perform key tasks identified in your research.
- Outline the basic layout of each screen or interface that will be part of your prototype. Consider user flows for each major task.

### Step 2: Create the prototype

- Use prototyping software like **Figma** or **Axure RP** to create your low-fidelity prototype. This should be a rough visual representation, focusing more on structure and flow than on visual design aesthetics.
- Your prototype should allow users to navigate through each main task. Each screen should include labeled buttons, sections, and interactions needed for users to complete these tasks.

**Deliverable:** Submit a link to your lo-fi prototype that includes the core screens and key navigation elements. Ensure the prototype is organized and labeled to show the intended flow of user interactions.

## 2. Conducting User Testing

### Step 1: Define testing goals

Determine what you want to learn from user testing. This may include:

- **Usability:** Can users navigate the interface with ease?
- **Functionality:** Do the key tasks and elements align with user expectations?
- **Pain points:** Are there any areas that confuse or frustrate users?

### Step 2: Set up test scenarios

Develop a list of tasks for users to complete using the prototype. These tasks should reflect the core functionalities identified in your research.

**Example tasks:**
- For a coffee pre-ordering app, tasks might include selecting a drink, customizing options, and navigating to checkout.
- For a music playlist app, tasks could include creating a playlist, adding songs, and managing playlist order.

### Step 3: Conduct testing with 3-5 users

- Allow each participant to interact with the prototype, completing the tasks you've outlined. Observe how they navigate and note any challenges they face.
- Encourage participants to **think aloud**, sharing their thoughts as they interact with the prototype.

**Deliverable:** A user testing report (1-2 pages) that includes:
- The tasks each participant was asked to complete
- Observations from testing, noting specific areas where users struggled or succeeded
- Feedback on usability and functionality, with suggestions for improvement

## 3. Reflection and Next Steps

After completing the prototype and user testing, reflect on what you learned and identify adjustments for the next iteration.

### Step 1: Summarize insights and challenges

Reflect on key takeaways from user testing and whether the prototype met users' expectations for functionality and usability.

### Step 2: Plan adjustments

Based on the feedback received, outline any necessary changes for the next prototype iteration. These could include adding features, adjusting the layout, or simplifying navigation.

**Deliverable:** A reflection (1-2 pages) that summarizes the insights from testing and details specific changes to implement in the next iteration.

## Final Deliverable

Submit a document to the dropbox with the **URL to the prototype**, the **user testing report**, and **overall reflections**.
