# Prototype Project: Video Walkthrough

> **This is an individual submission.** The focus should be on the work that YOU did on the project.

## Instructions

The video walkthrough should provide a narrated demonstration of the task you implemented in your prototype. This is to ensure that when grading it, we don't miss something that you included.

- It does not require captioning.
- There is not a length requirement; it just needs to show the full range of functionality.

## Tips

One easy way to do this is by sharing your screen in a Zoom meeting (even if nobody else is in the meeting), and recording the walkthrough and narration. You can then edit the files in a video editing program.

## Deliverable

Upload the video to **YouTube**, and provide a link to it here.

Alternatively, you can put the video in **Google Drive**, but you **MUST** make sure that you set the sharing up so that anyone with a link can access it.
