# Prototype Project: Proposal

## Objective

Form teams and define a clear project proposal by either:

- **Identifying specific user problems** to solve, or
- **Choosing an existing piece of software** to redesign

Each team member will also create a task flow that outlines a task a user currently performs, identify pain points along the way, and provide high-level potential solutions.

## Instructions

### Form your team

Work in groups of 3. Ensure that each person has a role and responsibility within the project.

### Choose your focus

Your team can either:

- **Identify new problems** that users are facing and propose a solution.
- **Redesign an existing piece of software** by addressing user pain points and improving the user experience.

**Example (Identifying a problem):**
Your team might choose the problem of "long wait times in coffee shops during morning rush hours."

**Example (Redesigning software):**
Your team could choose to redesign an app like Spotify to improve how users manage all of their custom playlists.

> Before beginning, please watch the **"Interaction Design: Flow"** course on LinkedIn Learning (it's only 29 minutes). You'll need that for the user and task flow diagram guidelines.

### Define your target users

Identify a group of people affected by this problem or who use the existing software. Be specific about who they are (e.g., age group, habits, location). Why do they care about this issue?

**Examples:**
- For the coffee shop problem, your target users might be "working professionals in their 20s-40s who regularly buy coffee during their morning commute."
- For the Spotify redesign, your target users might be "music lovers who often create and manage large playlists for specific activities like workouts or study sessions."

### Create individual task flows

Each team member must choose one task that a user currently performs within the context of the problem or software you are focusing on.

- Create a **task flow** that illustrates the current user experience, step-by-step, as the user attempts to accomplish the task.
- **Identify pain points** or areas where the user experiences frustration, confusion, or delays during the current experience.
- At this stage, you are focusing on the **current experience without proposing improvements**. Keep the task flow grounded in how users currently interact with the system or product.

You can utilize your Week 6 writeup for this.

**Examples:**
- For the coffee shop problem, potential task flows could follow a user's experience from entering the shop and knowing where to go to order/wait in line, the process of ordering, the payment process, or picking up their coffee. Pain points might include long wait times, confusing shop layouts, difficult-to-read menu options, or issues with payment systems.
- For the Spotify redesign, a task flow might follow a user trying to create and manage a playlist. Pain points could include difficulties searching for songs, managing large playlists, or awkward sorting options.

### Propose high-level potential solutions

After identifying the pain points in the current task flow, suggest high-level potential solutions that your product or redesign could offer to address these challenges. These are broad ideas at this stage, focusing on improving the user experience based on the identified pain points.

**Examples:**
- For the coffee shop problem, high-level solutions could include offering mobile ordering options to skip the line or streamlining the payment process with pre-paid accounts.
- For the Spotify redesign, potential solutions might include better filtering options for managing large playlists or smarter search features that predict the user's intent.

### Write the proposal

As a team, create a document (2-3 pages) that includes:

1. **Problem Statement or Redesign Focus:** A brief description of the problem you are solving or the software you are redesigning.
2. **Target Users:** Who are they, and how are they affected by the problem or by the current software design?
3. **Task Flows:** Each team member should contribute their task flow based on the current user experience, including pain points.
4. **Initial Ideas:** A high-level overview of how the team plans to address the problem or redesign the software.

## Deliverable

Submit a **2-3 page project proposal** document that includes the problem statement or redesign focus, target users, task flows (based on the current experience with pain points), and high-level potential solutions.
