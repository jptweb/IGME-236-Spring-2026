# Prototype Project: Proposal

## Objective

Form teams and define a clear project proposal by either (1) identifying specific user problems to solve, or (2) choosing an existing piece of software to redesign. Each team member will also create an individual task flow documenting a current user experience, the pain points within it, and high-level potential solutions. Your project must focus on a **digital interactive interface** (mobile apps, web platforms, kiosks, dashboards, etc.).

## Instructions

### 1. Meet your team

- **Team size:** Groups of 3 (one group of 2).
- **Roles & responsibilities:** Ensure each team member has a role and responsibility within the project. These roles may change throughout the semester, but make sure you discuss each phase together and decide how you will split the work.

### 2. Choose your focus

Your team can take one of the following approaches:

- **Option A — Identify a problem:** Identify new problems that users are facing and propose a solution.
- **Option B — Redesign existing software:** Redesign an existing piece of software by addressing user pain points and improving the user experience.

**Example (Identifying a problem):**
Your team might choose the problem of "long wait times in coffee shops during morning rush hours."

**Example (Redesigning software):**
Your team could choose to redesign an app like Spotify to improve how users manage all of their custom playlists.

#### Scope guidelines

Your proposal should focus on a problem that is:

- **Specific** — not "improve social media"
- **User-centered** — not "make a company more profitable"
- **Interaction-focused** — must involve user workflows
- **Prototype-able** — feasible within the semester

### 3. Watch the required prep video

Before creating your task flows, watch **[Interaction Design: Flow](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/interaction-design-flow/the-power-of-flow-in-interaction-design?u=42272537)** on LinkedIn Learning (29 minutes). You will need it for the user and task flow diagram guidelines. LinkedIn Learning is free for RIT students — see [how to access it](https://infoguides.rit.edu/linkedinlearning) if you haven't set it up yet.

### 4. Define your target users

Identify a specific group of people affected by the problem or who use the existing software. Be specific about who they are (age group, habits, location, context). Explain why they care about this issue.

**Examples:**
- For the coffee shop problem, your target users might be "working professionals in their 20s–40s who regularly buy coffee during their morning commute."
- For the Spotify redesign, your target users might be "music lovers who often create and manage large playlists for specific activities like workouts or study sessions."

### 5. Create draft personas

Now that you've defined your target users as a group, each team should create **2 personas** that represent different types of people within that user group. These are **draft personas** — you're working from your current understanding and assumptions, not deep research. That's okay. In a real UX process (and later in this project), personas get refined as you learn more through user research. Starting with drafts now gives your team a shared picture of who you're designing for.

**How personas differ from target users:** Your target users section (Step 4) defines the *group* — the broad audience and why they care. Personas zoom in on *individuals* within that group. They have names, specific habits, goals, frustrations, and context. Target users answer "who are we designing for?" Personas answer "what is it like to *be* one of these people?"

**What to include in each persona:**
- Name, age, brief background
- Goals — what are they trying to accomplish?
- Frustrations — what gets in their way?
- Context — when, where, and how do they encounter this problem or use this software?
- Any relevant habits, skills, or constraints

**Choose personas that show range.** The two personas should represent meaningfully different perspectives within your user group — different experience levels, different contexts of use, different motivations, etc. Your team decides what distinctions matter most for your project.

You practiced building personas in Week 6 — use whatever format or tool worked for you then (Figma template, Xtensio, or a simple written format in your proposal document).

### 6. Create individual task flows (current experience)

Each team member must choose one task that a user currently performs in the context of your chosen problem or software. Your task flow should represent the **current user experience** before proposing improvements. Think of this as investigative UX research — you are mapping reality before redesigning it.

- **Task selection:** Choose one task that a user currently performs within your project context.
- **Task flow diagram:** Create a step-by-step task flow showing how the user attempts to accomplish the task.
- **Pain points:** Identify where the user experiences frustration, confusion, delays, or breakdowns along the way.
- **Important:** At this stage, focus on the current experience — do not redesign the flow yet.

**Examples:**
- For the coffee shop problem, task flows might include entering the shop and figuring out where to order, waiting in line, ordering, paying, or picking up the drink. Pain points might include long waits, confusing layouts, hard-to-read menus, or payment friction.
- For the Spotify redesign, a task flow might follow a user creating or managing a playlist. Pain points might include searching for songs, sorting, filtering, or managing very large lists.

### 7. Propose high-level potential solutions

After identifying pain points in the current task flow, suggest high-level potential solutions your product or redesign could offer. These should be broad ideas at this stage — not detailed UI designs yet.

**Examples:**
- For the coffee shop problem, high-level solutions could include mobile ordering to skip the line, or streamlining payment with pre-paid accounts.
- For the Spotify redesign, potential solutions might include better filtering tools for large playlists, or smarter search that predicts user intent.

### 8. Write the proposal (team document)

As a team, create a document that includes:

1. **Problem Statement or Redesign Focus:** A brief description of the problem you are solving or the software you are redesigning.
2. **Target Users:** Who are they, and how are they affected by the problem or by the current software design?
3. **Draft Personas:** 2 personas representing different types of users within your target group.
4. **Task Flows:** Each team member contributes one task flow based on the current user experience, including pain points.
5. **Initial Ideas:** A high-level overview of how the team plans to address the problem or redesign the software.

## Deliverable

Submit your project proposal as a **PDF** to the myCourses dropbox. Only one submission needed per team.

Must include: problem statement or redesign focus, target users, draft personas, task flows (current experience with pain points), and high-level potential solutions.

## AI Expectations

AI use for this assignment is allowed in a **limited, supportive role**.

**You may use AI tools to:**
- Support writing clarity, organization, tone, or grammar in the proposal document
- Assist in structuring sections such as problem statements or user descriptions
- Help generate or refine search queries when researching existing software or user contexts
- Provide general background information about platforms, industries, or interaction patterns

**AI may not be used to:**
- Identify or define your project problem or redesign focus
- Determine your project direction or core concept
- Define your target users without team discussion and reasoning
- Generate personas, task flows, or map the current user experience
- Identify pain points you have not personally observed or researched
- Propose solutions in place of your team's own design thinking

This proposal is intended to reflect your team's original UX investigation and early framing work. All task flows, pain points, and solution ideas must come from your team's own analysis, even if AI is later used to refine presentation.

If AI tools are used, include a brief acknowledgment describing how they were used.
