# Week 2 Day 2: Critique + Concepts

> **About these notes:** Day 1 each week will typically have polished slides with graphics and videos. Day 2 I'll throw together a markdown document covering anything I didn't explain well, ran out of time for, or want to emphasize before you dive into activities.
>
> This doesn't replace your myCourses checklist—that's your authoritative to-do list. This is just a quick guide for what we're working through today.

## Quick Concept Recap

We covered a lot of vocabulary Tuesday. Two concepts we moved through quickly:

### Gulf of Execution vs Gulf of Evaluation

**Gulf of Execution** = "How do I DO this?"
The gap between what you want to do and figuring out how to do it.

**Gulf of Evaluation** = "Did it WORK?"
The gap between what happened and understanding what happened.

**Example - a thermostat:**
- Execution: Which way do I turn this? Does up mean warmer?
- Evaluation: I changed it... is it actually heating now? How do I know?

**For your critiques today:** These help you pinpoint WHERE a design failed.
- Users didn't know what to do? → Execution problem (bad affordances/signifiers)
- Users did something but didn't know if it worked? → Evaluation problem (bad feedback)

### Knowledge in Head vs Knowledge in World

| | In the Head | In the World |
|---|---|---|
| **What** | Memorized/learned | Visible in environment |
| **Pro** | Fast once learned | No learning required |
| **Con** | Must learn first | Clutters interface |
| **Example** | Keyboard shortcuts | Menu items |

Your "good affordance" object probably puts more knowledge in the world. Your "bad affordance" object probably assumes knowledge you don't have.

## Today's In-Class Exercise

**New this week:** We're adding short in-class exercises on Day 2. These are separate from your writeup—quicker, less polished, done during class. Most weeks going forward will have one.

**The gist:** Discuss your group's sketches, then assess them using this week's concepts (signifiers, feedback, gulfs). Each person submits a short individual document picking good/bad examples. See myCourses for full instructions.

**Due tonight** (24-hour extension available) | **No AI** for this one

## Writeup Reminder (Due Sunday)

**Week 2 Writeup - Familiar Object** | 300-500 words | Due Sunday 11:59 PM

Reflect on your sketches and critique using this week's vocabulary. See myCourses for full instructions.

**AI Policy:** Write your draft first, then you may use AI for polishing. If you use AI, you must disclose it (tool, prompt, reflection). Undisclosed AI use = irreversible zero. Check the assignment for details—AI policies vary week to week.

## A Word About AI (and Don Norman)

Don Norman wrote our foundational text this week. He's 90 and still actively thinking about design - including AI.

**Two things he's said recently:**

1. On how AI was trained ([video clip](https://youtu.be/FMbP4pRxT2k?t=1816)): *"It's not fair and it's probably illegal... we took other people's paintings and artworks and music and writings and stuck them into this computer. We never asked permission."*

2. On using AI as a designer ([video clip](https://youtu.be/g4qrd1UT_PA?t=4452)): *"I want you to learn and use AI systems... it will make you a better designer. It frees up time to think more deeply about what you're trying to accomplish."*

In the second clip, Norman describes feeding his own books into Google's NotebookLM, listening to the AI podcast it generated, then *interrupting to correct it* when it was too agreeable and missed the hard parts.
