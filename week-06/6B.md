## Prototype Team Formation Survey

We're forming teams for the semester prototype project. I'll walk through the survey briefly — what it asks and why.

- **Open it now** and start filling it out: [Survey Link](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeEpZTJ3eKch1bn2Tx43DQYR_aMy7nxE7jW9Oi4QcaDAwFIxQ/viewform) (or short URL if your viewing printed version: https://bit.ly/4aWCn66)
- You **don't have to finish today** — you can reopen it and submit later
- **Due Sunday Feb 22, 11:59 PM**
- Use some time today to talk with classmates — if you want to request specific teammates on the form, now's a good time to connect

## Sketch Critique: Prototype Ideas / UI Sketches

Get into your groups. This week your sketches shifted from physical objects to **UI interfaces** — you picked a pain point from the Slack channel and sketched what a prototype solution might look like.

**For each person's sketches, discuss:**

1. **What pain point did you pick?** What's the core frustration? Who does it affect?
2. Discuss with others if they had a similar hardship using the interface, you will need to have some other sources having similar issues so you might be able to get this out the way! (other sources could be user forum posts, reddit posts etc....), You will use these in your writeup.
3. What might a fix to this pain point of it entail.
4. Does this relate to one of the principles like "Finding the right problem", could this have been the reason why the pain point manifested.
5. How could you test this to verify its a problem? Interviews / observations etc..
   
   IGNORE THESE: these would be done if we had actually drawn the "solution / fix"
6. ~~**Walk through your UI sketch.** What does the user see? What can they do? What's different from the current experience?~~
7. ~~**Does this address the root problem?** Think about Don Norman's principle: are you solving a *symptom* or the *fundamental issue*? Would this fix actually change the experience?~~
8. ~~**Which part of the Design Thinking process is this?** You're in the **Ideate** stage — turning defined problems into possible solutions. Does the sketch feel like a reasonable response to what you defined, or did it jump ahead?~~
9. ~~**What would you want to test?** If you built this, what's the first thing you'd put in front of a user to see if it works?~~

**Keep in mind for your writeup:** This week's writeup asks you to research whether other people share the pain point you're addressing. The feedback you get today — especially whether your group members have experienced the same problem — is directly useful. Take notes.

## In-Class Persona Exercise

**Task:** Create a persona for a **first-year GCCIS student user of myCourses.** (Doesn't matter if your sketch was about myCourses.)

**A note on data:** In practice, strong personas are built on real research — interviews, surveys, observation. Today we're working from your collective experience as students, which is a reasonable starting point for practice. But keep in mind: the more real data behind a persona, the more useful it is. Assumptions feel right but can miss things. This is something you'll see firsthand when you compare your hand-made persona to the AI-generated one.

### Step 1: Group Brainstorm (15-20 min)

As a group, discuss what you know about this type of user. Use a shared Google Doc or the whiteboard.

Think about:
- What experience do they have with learning management systems (Canvas, Schoology, Google Classroom from high school)?
- How much do they know about online calendars and notifications?
- What tools do they use to keep track of class info? (Phone reminders? Sticky notes? Nothing?)
- What frustrates them about navigating myCourses? (Finding assignments, understanding what's due, grade visibility?)
- What are their goals? (Just pass? Stay organized? Get ahead?)

### Step 2: Individual Persona (remaining time)

Each person creates **your own** persona document using one of these tools:

- **Figma** — search "[user persona](https://www.figma.com/community/search?query=user%20persona&resource_type=files&editor_type=figma&price=free&sort_by=relevancy&creators=all)" in Community templates (free)
	  REMINDER: you don't need the "pro" / student version to just do this basic stuff in figma, but you will for the collaborative Prototypes which i'm encouraging you to use. So if you haven't gotten your student account yet you can use a free tier, BUT please starting following that guide I gave you to get the student account. If the automated process fails it could take time to get manually approved, you may need to open ticket.
- **[Xtensio](https://xtensio.com/)** — persona builder (free tier)
- **[UserForge](https://userforge.com/)** — persona creator (free)

Don't overthink it — pick a template, fill it in, done. This is graded as **missing / minimal / meets requirements.** It's practice.

### Submit

- Upload a **PNG or PDF** of your persona to myCourses
- **Due Friday Feb 20, 11:59 PM** (tonight or tomorrow night)
- In Figma: select the frame → Export option at bottom-right of the panel

**AI is NOT allowed** for this exercise. All content must come from your group discussion and your own thinking. You'll use AI for the *next* persona assignment — that's the whole point of the comparison.

## Reminders & Due Dates

| What | When |
|------|------|
| In-Class Persona Exercise | **Fri Feb 20, 11:59 PM** |
| AI-Assisted Persona Generation and Reflection | **Fri Feb 20, 11:59 PM** |
| Week 6 Writeup — Prototype Idea User Research | **Sun Feb 22, 11:59 PM** |
| Prototype Team Formation Survey | **Sun Feb 22, 11:59 PM** |
| Week 7 readings + Study Quiz | **Check myCourses Friday** — readings will be published by end of day |

**About the AI Persona assignment:** After you finish the hand-made persona above, use an AI tool (Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT) to generate a second persona for the same user type, then write a reflection comparing the two. The generation takes ~5 minutes; the reflection takes longer. See myCourses for full instructions and prompt options.

**About the Writeup:** This one is different from past writeups. Pick one of the pain points you discussed today. Research whether other people have the same problem — check Slack comments, forums, Reddit, product reviews, and talk to at least one real user. Summarize where you looked, what you found, and how common the problem is. 300-500 words. See myCourses for full details.
